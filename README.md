# Treehouse-Project-1-Portfolio
HowToMakeAWebsite Exercise

Hi there!

I'm currently following along the Treehouse (teamtreehouse.com | web learning platform) 
learning path of becoming a Frontend Developer / Webdesigner. 
Currently I'm still in the beginning, so my projects lack the 'amazing' factor. But just wait it'll all come along nicely.
This is the first of many projects witch I will be throughing on my domain annaliebermann.nl
Not to be confused with my blog annaliebermann.com


Thanks for showing interest! feel free to follow me on twitter: @annaliebermann

May the force be with you!
Anna Liebermann
